TUTORIAL ‚úèÔ∏è
CSS display Property
Every HTML element on a web page is treated a rectangular box. The display property in CSS determines just how that rectangular box behaves.

Common Uses
display: block is the default of elements like <div>, <p>, <section>, etc. Make an element start on a new line and take up the full width available. Can assign width & height. Tip: You would use it when you want elements to take up the full width of their container and appear on separate lines, like paragraphs, headings, or sections.

display: inline is the default of elements like <span>, <em>, etc. Wrapping text in inline elements within a string of text doesn‚Äôt break the flow of the text. Cannot assign width & height. Tip: It is handy when you want elements to appear next to each other on the same line, such as links within a paragraph or a series of small icons.

display: inline-block is the hybrid that functions like display: inline, but you can assign width & height. Tip: It's commonly used for creating navigation menus or arranging images horizontally.

display: none completely hides an element, making it disappear from the webpage. Use this when you want to hide an element, like a dropdown menu that appears only when triggered.
